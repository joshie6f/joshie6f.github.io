			<h1>Current Kills!?!</h1>

				If you've ever been around the electrical engineering community, 
				you've probably heard the phrase "Current kills!". 
				Although there is some truth to this statement its just drivel! The phrase, 
				"Its not the voltage that kills you, its the current", is being used more and more.
				 This phrase holds some truth but is very misleading and dangerous!

				<i>Current</i> is the measure of charge that passes a point in a period of time.
				In other words, Current is the derivative of Charge. <img src="img/DerCharge.PNG">.
				The following is a table from a Government safety document from the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
				The table tells you what happens to your body when different amounts of current flows through it for DC and 50 or 60HZ AC.

			<h1>Simplifying things</h1>
			<p>
			Although The effects of high current through the body look deadly, there is still a lot more to take into consideration.
			This problem consists of many changing variables like time, resistance, distance, humidity, perspiration, Ac, dc, etc.
			If we use Occam's razor and simplify the problem and only consider current, voltage, and resistance we can come up with the following.
			Georg Simon Ohm, a German physicist, can show the relationship between voltage and current. Ohm crated the equation ohms law. V = IR or Voltage = Current times resistance.
			The skin on the human body (in dry conditions) may have a resistance of up to 100,000 ohms. If we assume that a man named 
			Greg had a fixed resistance of 50,000 ohms across his tongue for instance and we supplied his tongue with 50 volts there would 
			only be 1mA across his tongue. For us to achieve a current of 1A we would be required to apply 50,000 volts across Greg's tongue.
			</p>

			<h1>Amping Things Up</h1>
			<!--<p>Now after Simplifying things, it is evident that current alone is not what kills but the current produced by a high enough voltage
				that can kill you. But what about time, or distance, change in resistanceor even frequency? 
				When The body interacts with a external source of voltage and/or current things start to change with time. 
			</p>
			<p>
			
			One variable we can ignore is the distance. But your probibly asking yourself, Why ignore distance? Or What distance?
			I am refreing to the distance from one terminal of the supply to the other. Since skin resistance electricity we 
			could view it like a resistor. When we more the terminals of the battery closer the resistance provided by the skin 
			decreases. This is the same idea used in potentiometers (Variable Resistors). If we assume that the same distance is 
			sustained then we can ignore this effect and pick a constant resistance. 
			
				The electrical resistance of hunam skin also changes with temprature.
