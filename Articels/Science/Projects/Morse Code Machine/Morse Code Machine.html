				After the rise of Escape Rooms, My friends and I discovered Virginia Tech's <a id="VTHunt" href="https://www.vthunt.com/">VTHunt ᚖᚌᚖ</a>. 
				A Mysterious Scavenger hunt run by VTHunt club Leader: Recam, at Virginia Tech. The hunt challenges groups of students with puzzles which sometimes involve subjects that would be 
				discussed in College Lectures. After participating in the 2020 Halloween Hunt My interest in The arts of cryptography was peaked and so I started to learn <i>Morse Code</i>!

				<i>In</i> 
				Order to assist and enhance my learning experience, I got the idea to create a machine that would allow me interact with Morse code as a learned it.
				The General Idea was to make a Morse code transmitter/Signal Generator. At the time, among all the classes I would have the following semiester of College
				was <i>Fundementals of Digital Circuits</i>. I thought it would be fun to work on a Digital Circuit as a leaned more about the topic to see how my 
				Knowledge grows and extends to the ability to create and/or Improve the circuit.
