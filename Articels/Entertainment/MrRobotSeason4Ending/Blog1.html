		The exciting news of Season 4's 
		release brought about some other news.
		Christian Slater has told fans that he believes that season 4 
		will bring about the end of mr.robot
		<i>"I believe that will be the last season. 
<br>
<br>
		Sam <b>[Esmail]</b> always said it was going to be somewhere in that 
		zone, and he didn't want to go further than what he could creatively 
		contribute to that storyline. So, I think that Season 4 will be it. I think they're 
		in the writers' room, as we speak, putting it all together, but i have no idea what it's 
		gonna be, or if i'm gonna be floating in and out of scenes."</i>
		Christian Slater said This during an interview
